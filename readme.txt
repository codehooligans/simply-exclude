2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Navigate to you PostS/Pages/Category/Tags or any Post Type or Taxonomy sections. You will notice a new column allowing setting of the Taxonomy or Post type item in relation to selectively exclude/include the cat/tag/page for the given action is_front/is_archive/is_feed/is_search. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I've excluded all my categories and all tags why am I seeing my 404 page? =

Well you need to be careful when excluding both categories and tags. Since a post can be associated with both there is potential that you have excluded all your posts because they are either members of excluded categories or members or excluded tags. 

= I've excluded Pages but attachments (images) for those pages are showing up. Why? =

Only the parent Page itself is excluded from searches. By default WordPress does not yet include Pages in search. Make sure you have other search plugins correctly configured to not search attachments. 

= I've excluded a Page via the plugin but it still shows up in my sidebar when wp_list_pages is called. Why? =

At the time (version 1.6.1) the plugin only effects Pages included in the traditional Search feature on a site. It does not trap all selections of Pages via other internal WordPress functions...yet!

Small bug. On the new Simply Exclude Help panel I user the jQuery UI Accordion package. Seems I failed to check this when setting the minimum WordPress version I was supporting (3.2). Seems jQuery UI Accordion is not available in core WordPress until version 3.3. So have added my own libraries to cover the older versions of WordPress. Sorry about that. And thanks to @biswajeet for bringing this up in the WordPress forums.
